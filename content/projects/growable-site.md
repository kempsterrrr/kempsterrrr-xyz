[Growable](https://www.growable.io/) is a London based tech meetup series I founded with [Pete Rowe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterrowe/) in summer 2019. Our aim was to provide a platform to allow customers we work with via Talent Point to share useful insight from solving real world engineering problems at scale.

The site is a [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) project built using Gatsby, Netlify and Sendgrid, offering event registration functionality without a backend by making use of Netlify's amazing [functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) product and Sendgrid's API.

**Tech Stack**: Gatsby, Netlify and Sendgrid

**Team**: Murray Adcock, myself

[Talent Point](https://www.talentpoint.co/) is a London based hiring consultancy I work for as a Senior Account Manager. Although my job title may not suggest it, I spend around a 1/3rd of my time developing websties and SPAs using React.js and after the successful launch of [Growable](https://www.growable.io), we decided to invest in a rebrand and rebuild of Talent Point itself.

We chose to adopt the same stack we'd had success wtih building Growable. Therefor this site is also a [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) project built using Gatsby, Netlify and Sendgrid, mkaing use of Netlify's [functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) product and Sendgrid's API to offer sing-up and contact functionality without the need for a custom backend.

**Tech Stack**: Gatsby, Netlify and Sendgrid

**Team**: [Murray Adcock](https://www.theadhocracy.co.uk/), myself
